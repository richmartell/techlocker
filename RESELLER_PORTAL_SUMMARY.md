# Reseller Portal - Implementation Summary

## Status: Foundation Complete ✅

I've built the complete database foundation and authentication system for the Reseller Portal. Here's what's been implemented:

---

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Database Structure

**New Tables Created:**
- ✅ `resellers` - Reseller accounts with authentication
- ✅ `commissions` - Track commissions earned by resellers
- ✅ `accounts` table updated - Added `reseller_id` foreign key

**Resellers Table:**
```php
- id
- name
- email (unique)
- password (hashed)
- company_name
- phone
- commission_rate (decimal, default 10%)
- is_active (boolean)
- remember_token
- timestamps
```

**Commissions Table:**
```php
- id
- reseller_id (foreign key)
- account_id (foreign key)
- amount (decimal)
- status (pending/paid/cancelled)
- earned_at (date)
- paid_at (date, nullable)
- notes (text, nullable)
- timestamps
```

### 2. Models Created

**Reseller Model** (`app/Models/Reseller.php`):
- ✅ Extends `Authenticatable` for login
- ✅ Relationships: `accounts()`, `commissions()`
- ✅ Helper attributes:
  - `trials_created` - Count of trials created
  - `trials_converted` - Count of converted trials
  - `total_commission_earned` - Total commission amount
  - `total_commission_paid` - Total paid commissions
  - `pending_commission` - Pending commission amount

**Commission Model** (`app/Models/Commission.php`):
- ✅ Relationships: `reseller()`, `account()`
- ✅ Status badge colors
- ✅ Amount casting to decimal

**Account Model** (Updated):
- ✅ Added `reseller_id` to fillable
- ✅ Added `reseller()` relationship

### 3. Authentication System

**Guards & Providers:**
- ✅ Added `reseller` guard in `config/auth.php`
- ✅ Added `resellers` provider
- ✅ Password reset support for resellers

**Middleware:**
- ✅ `ResellerAuthenticate` middleware created
- ✅ Registered in bootstrap/app.php as `'reseller'`
- ✅ Checks authentication and active status

### 4. Migrations Run Successfully
- ✅ All migrations executed
- ✅ Database schema updated

## 🚧 Next Steps (What Needs to be Built)

To complete the Reseller Portal, you'll need to create these Livewire components:

### Reseller Portal Components:

1. **Reseller\Auth\Login** - Login page
2. **Reseller\Dashboard** - Dashboard with stats
3. **Reseller\Customers\Index** - List of customer accounts
4. **Reseller\Customers\Create** - Create trial for customer
5. **Reseller\Commissions\Index** - View commissions

### Admin Portal Components (for managing resellers):

1. **Admin\Resellers\Index** - List all resellers
2. **Admin\Resellers\Upsert** - Create/edit resellers
3. **Admin\Resellers\Show** - View reseller details & performance

### Routes Needed:

**Reseller Routes** (`routes/reseller.php`):
```php
- GET /reseller/login
- POST /reseller/logout
- GET /reseller/dashboard
- GET /reseller/customers
- POST /reseller/customers/create
- GET /reseller/commissions
```

**Admin Routes** (update `routes/admin.php`):
```php
- GET /admin/resellers
- GET /admin/resellers/create
- GET /admin/resellers/{reseller}/edit
- GET /admin/resellers/{reseller}
```

### Layouts Needed:

1. **Reseller Layout** (`resources/views/components/layouts/reseller.blade.php`)
   - Navigation: Dashboard, Customers, Commissions
   - Simpler than admin layout

---

## 📊 Database Relationships

```
Reseller (1) ──< (Many) Accounts
Reseller (1) ──< (Many) Commissions
Account (1) ──< (1) Commission
Plan (1) ──< (Many) Accounts
```

---

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Separate authentication for resellers
- ✅ Active status checking
- ✅ Password hashing
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Middleware protection

---

## 💡 Business Logic

### Trial Creation by Reseller:
When a reseller creates a trial:
1. Create Account with:
   - `reseller_id` = current reseller's ID
   - `trial_started_at` = now()
   - `trial_ends_at` = now() + 14 days
   - `trial_status` = 'active'
2. Optionally send invitation email to customer

### Commission Calculation:
When a trial converts to paid:
1. Update Account: `trial_status` = 'converted'
2. Create Commission record:
   - `reseller_id` = account's reseller_id
   - `account_id` = converted account
   - `amount` = plan price × reseller commission_rate
   - `status` = 'pending'
   - `earned_at` = today

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines

### Reseller Portal:
- **Simpler** than admin portal
- Focus on: Trials, Conversions, Commissions
- Mobile-friendly
- Limited actions (can't edit plans or limits)

### Admin Portal (Reseller Section):
- Full management capabilities
- Performance metrics
- Commission management
- Account associations

---

## 📝 Commission Structure Example

**Default: 10% commission rate**

Example: Reseller refers customer who converts to £64.99/month plan
- Commission earned: £64.99 × 10% = £6.50
- Status: Pending until admin marks as "Paid"
- Recurring: Create commission each month account stays subscribed

---

## 🔄 Workflow

### Reseller Creates Trial:
1. Reseller logs in
2. Goes to "Create Customer"
3. Enters customer details
4. System creates account with 14-day trial
5. System links account to reseller
6. Invitation email sent (optional)

### Trial Converts:
1. Admin updates trial_status to "converted"
2. System creates commission record
3. Commission shows in reseller's dashboard
4. Admin can later mark commission as "paid"

### Reseller Views Performance:
- Dashboard shows:
  - Total trials created
  - Trials converted
  - Conversion rate
  - Total commission earned
  - Pending vs paid commissions

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Tips

### For Reseller Dashboard Component:
```php
public function getStatsProperty()
{
    $reseller = Auth::guard('reseller')->user();
    
    return [
        'trials_created' => $reseller->trials_created,
        'trials_converted' => $reseller->trials_converted,
        'conversion_rate' => $reseller->trials_created > 0 
            ? round(($reseller->trials_converted / $reseller->trials_created) * 100, 1) 
            : 0,
        'total_earned' => $reseller->total_commission_earned,
        'total_paid' => $reseller->total_commission_paid,
        'pending' => $reseller->pending_commission,
    ];
}
```

### For Creating Trial (Reseller):
```php
public function createTrial()
{
    $this->validate();
    
    $account = Account::create([
        'company_name' => $this->company_name,
        'company_email' => $this->email,
        'reseller_id' => Auth::guard('reseller')->id(),
        'trial_started_at' => now(),
        'trial_ends_at' => now()->addDays(14),
        'trial_status' => 'active',
        // ... other fields
    ]);
    
    // Optionally create first user for the account
    User::create([
        'account_id' => $account->id,
        'name' => $this->contact_name,
        'email' => $this->email,
        'password' => Hash::make(Str::random(16)), // Temporary
        // ... send password reset email
    ]);
    
    return redirect()->route('reseller.customers');
}
```

### For Commission Payment (Admin):
```php
public function markAsPaid($commissionId)
{
    $commission = Commission::findOrFail($commissionId);
    $commission->update([
        'status' => 'paid',
        'paid_at' => now(),
    ]);
}
```

---

## 📦 Seeder Example

Create `database/seeders/ResellerSeeder.php`:
```php
Reseller::create([
    'name' => 'John Smith',
    'email' => 'reseller@example.com',
    'password' => Hash::make('password'),
    'company_name' => 'Smith Resellers Ltd',
    'phone' => '07700 900000',
    'commission_rate' => 10.00,
    'is_active' => true,
]);
```

## 🚀 Quick Start for Development

1. **Create a test reseller:**
   ```bash
   sail artisan tinker
   \App\Models\Reseller::create([
       'name' => 'Test Reseller',
       'email' => 'reseller@test.com',
       'password' => Hash::make('password'),
       'commission_rate' => 10,
       'is_active' => true,
   ]);
   ```

2. **Create reseller routes file**
3. **Build Livewire components** (see Next Steps above)
4. **Create reseller layout**
5. **Test login at `/reseller/login`**

---

## 📚 Documentation Needed

Once components are built, create:
- `RESELLER_PORTAL.md` - Complete reseller portal docs
- `RESELLER_ADMIN_GUIDE.md` - Admin guide for managing resellers
- Update `ADMIN_PORTAL.md` with reseller management section

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- Automated commission calculation on conversion
- Email notifications for new trials
- Reseller performance reports
- Commission payment reminders
- Multi-level commission structures
- Reseller analytics dashboard
- Custom commission rates per reseller
