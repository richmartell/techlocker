### Commission Calculation

**How It Works:**
1. Customer converts from trial to active subscription
2. System calculates: `Plan Price √ó Commission Rate`
   - Example: ¬£79.99 √ó 10% = ¬£7.99
3. Commission record created with status: `pending`
4. Each month, recurring commission generated
5. Admin marks commissions as `paid`
6. Total updates reflect payment

**Example Scenario:**

```
Reseller: 10% commission rate
Customer: Converts to Professional plan (¬£79.99/mo)

Month 1: ¬£7.99 (pending ‚Üí paid)
Month 2: ¬£7.99 (pending)
Month 3: ¬£7.99 (pending)
...continues while customer active
```

**When Commission Stops:**
- Customer cancels subscription (status: `churned`)
- No new commission records generated
- Pending commissions still valid
